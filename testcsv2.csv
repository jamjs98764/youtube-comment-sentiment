z121wl1hwkemdpfhc04cctc4jqyafbepqxw0k,Donald Trump,5 hours ago,1488466073649,"People need to give trump a chance. He's only been in office for a month and he's already done more than obama. The Obama administration was and will forever be known as corrupt. Anyone who thinks different is naive and shows true ignorance. Trump loves this country and wants to keep it safe from rapist, terrorist and drug dealers. I believe the wall and ban are a great idea. Most illegal Mexicans bring in drugs and are known rapist while the ban limits terrorist from coming into our country. You liberals defending them and wanting these people in our country are responsible for the horrrific crimes done by them towards the American people. Muslims, Mexicans are known to be very bad people, I know it's not PC but it's the truth. Trump has kept all his promises and the American people love it. Donald trump won the election - majority of America wanted this. If 3-5 million illegals didn't vote he'd win the popular vote as well.",0

No one escapes from their own birthplace just to go and commit crimes in a foreign land. They are coming to get a better life, not a lawless one. Of course, there will be some bad elements, but they can be weeded out. The real reason of crime is socio-economic. And I think immigrants will exhibit a lesser amount of criminal activity than the native ones. And those who really want to hurt the country will always find some way, even if there's a complete lock down in the country. The best we can do is be vigilant and hunt them down before they hurt us.",70
